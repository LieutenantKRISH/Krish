 list of all possible coordinates within a given cuboid dimensions, excluding coordinates where the sum of the three values is equal to a given number.
the code for this...

 HOW TO SOLVE:- "You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the dimensions of a cuboid, along with an integer n.
 Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i, j, and k is not equal to n."

if _ _name_ _ == '_ _main_ _':
    x = int(input(""))
    y = int(input(""))
    z = int(input(""))
    n = int(input(""))
    coordinates = []
    for i in range(x+1):
      for j in range(y+1):
        for k in range(z+1):
          if i+j+k != n:
            coordinates.append([i,j,k])
    print(coordinates)
    
EXPLANATION:-
(1)   if __name__ == '__main__':

This line checks if the code is being run as the main program and not imported as a module. 
It ensures that the following code block will only execute if the file is being run directly.

(2)   x = int(input()), y = int(input()), z = int(input()), n = int(input()):

These lines prompt the user to enter four integer values for x, y, z, and n.
The input() function reads the user's input as a string, and the int() function is used to convert the string input into integer values.


(3)   coordinates = []:

This line initializes an empty list called coordinates where we will store the valid coordinates that satisfy the condition.


(4)   Nested Loops:

The code then enters three nested loops using for statements:
for i in range(x + 1) iterates over the values from 0 to x.
for j in range(y + 1) iterates over the values from 0 to y.
for k in range(z + 1) iterates over the values from 0 to z.
These loops cover all possible combinations of values for i, j, and k within the given dimensions x, y, and z.


(5)   Condition Check:

Within the nested loops, the code checks the condition if i + j + k != n.
If the sum of i, j, and k is not equal to n, it means the current combination of coordinates satisfies the condition.
In this case, [i, j, k] is appended to the coordinates list using coordinates.append([i, j, k]).


(5)   Print Result:

After the nested loops complete execution, the list coordinates contains all the valid coordinates that meet the condition.
Finally, the code prints the coordinates list using print(coordinates).
